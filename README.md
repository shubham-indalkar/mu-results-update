## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

### Get a Telegram Bot token

&nbsp; 1. Visit <https://t.me/BotFather> or find `@BotFather` on your Telegram to register a new bot.

&nbsp; 2. Send `/newbot` command to BotFather.

&nbsp; 3. Set a name for the bot and a username (ending with 'bot').

&nbsp; 4. When registration process is completed, BotFather will provide an HTTP API token for the bot.

### Get the channel ID

&nbsp; 1. Create a new channel and post any message in it.

&nbsp; 2. Forward that message to <https://t.me/get_id_channel_bot>.

&nbsp; 3. The bot will give the unique ID of your channel.

### Bot setup

&nbsp; 1. Add the bot to your channel.

&nbsp; 2. Give admin rights to the bot.


### Declare your keys in environment

Running the bot in local will required creating an `.env` file with the following contents:

```python
BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
CHANNEL_ID=YOUR_CHANNEL_ID
```

> Note:
> - `BOT_TOKEN` should be put as String and `CHANNEL_ID` should be put as Integer.
> - For security, `.env` file is only suitable for local run. In case of deployment, your keys should be kept as `SECRETS` or `ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES` that can only be accessed by you (checkout render branch).

## Local Deployment

```
&nbsp; or

  python channel.py

## Possible Improvements

- Add more functionalities to the bot.

- Track edited results.

## Telegram Channel: `@mu_result_updates`

Join the Telegram channel [here](https://t.me/mu_result_updates) to receive the latest current year MU exam results as soon as they are announced.

Please note that the bot's availability depends on the Mumbai University exam results website and the Telegram API. In case of any issues, you can check the logs or contact [me](https://t.me/andrio_official) for assistance.

**Note:** Make sure to keep the `count.json` file in the same directory as the bot script. It stores the count of declared results and ensures that only new results are posted.
